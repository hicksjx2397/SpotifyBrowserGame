Spotify Browser Game is a collaborative Angular-based web application developed as part of a group project. The core objective was to create an interactive guessing game that leverages the Spotify Web API. Players are challenged to identify songs based on short audio previews, testing their musical knowledge across different genres and playlists. My team and I focused on translating non-technical business requirements into a functional and user-friendly game, ensuring smooth integration with Spotify's API and a streamlined audio playback experience.

During the planning phase, we created wireframes in Figma, mapped out key components, and reviewed the available Spotify endpoints to determine how best to structure our app. This project emphasized collaborative planning, technical research, and a thoughtful approach to problem-solving before diving into development. Through this experience, I strengthened my skills in Angular, TypeScript, API integration, and project coordinationâ€”while also gaining valuable experience in interpreting stakeholder needs and transforming them into a working product.
